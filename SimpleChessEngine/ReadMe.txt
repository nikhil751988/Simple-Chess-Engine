###### PROJECT DESCRIPTION ######
#################################

This is a simple Data driven application to demonstrate the working of a simple chess engine.

This is a game played between human and the computer

The chess engine uses the move generation techniques for all the pieces on the board and applies
Alpha-Beta Pruning to make decisions.

This project also provides the end user to control the behavior of the chess engine.
The user can change certain engine parameters like search depth, branching factor, move ordering
and also specify what heuristics to be used by the chess engine in order to make its move

The above experiment is carried out to observe the decision making capablity of the Chess engine.
